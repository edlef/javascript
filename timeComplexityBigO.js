//Time complexity and Big O notation

//big O algorithm : how scalable an algorithm or function is
//0 = function we evaluate n = size of the input

//different types of runtimes :
//constant runtime : 0 (1) -> runtime stays the same even when input size increases
//linear runtime : 0 (n) -> runtime increases proportionnaly to input size
// exponential runtime : 0 (n^2) -> when we add one element to the input, the runtime makes an exponential jump
